# Embedded Systems Week 2 Training
## C/C++
Program <br>
Programming <br>
Programming language <br>
Translation <br>
Syntax - particular order you follow when writing computer instructions <br>
<hr>

### Machine language - 1st generation languages <br>
_01010011 01100001 01101101_ <br>
### Assembly language - 2nd generation languages <br>
MOV, AX 15 <br>
SUB, BX 10 <br>
### Structural & Procedural - 3rd generation languages <br>
Modularization - Use of modules <br>

Name| Number| 

### 4th generation languages <br>
Introduced a GUI <br>
C++ Visual basic Visual code

### 5th gen languages <br>
Introduced a computer solving problems for you 

### Objected Oriented Programming Languages (OOP) <br>
Introduced Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
C++, Java, Python

### Web scripting languages
HTML, CSS
<hr>

Source code, Preprocessor, Object code, Linker, Executable, Program <br>
<hr>

Source code - What you write in your editor <br>
Translators -> Assembler, Interpreter, Compiler, Linker <br>
Assember -> Converts code from computer language into binary <br>
Interpreter -> Translates source code line-by-line <br>
Compiler -> Translates source code as a whole <br>

Preprocessor commands -> Code that has already been compiled which perform specific tasks <br>
An example is the iostream command in C++ <br>
Linker -> Combines your object code with other commands to produce the final executable

## Program Development
Identify a problem <br>
Define the problem - Sudo code / Flowcharts <br>
Program design -> Developing algorithms <br>
Coding <br>
Program testing and debugging -> Error detection and correction <br>
Implementation and maintenance <br>
Program documentation <br>

### Different types of errors
Syntax errors -> Detected by the compiler <br>
Logic errors -> Undetected by the translator <br>
Runtime errors -> Cause the program to halt in execution -> Infinite loops <br>
User acceptability errors -> End-user is dissatisfied with the program <br>

# Assignment 
How to use the debugging tools in the IDE <br>
i.e. using a breakpoint <br>
i.e creating user test data <br>
--> Make a calculator <br>
--> How to integrate unit test data <br>
--> Make a blink program for blinking an LED <br>
--> How to make the standard blink program more efficient <br>
--> Find out the difference between strings in C and C++ <br>
--> Read about global and local **scope** of variables <br>
--> Experiment with functions <br>

## Tokens
The smallest bit of code that makes sense to a compiler

| Keyword | Special meaning to the compiler | int double for | <br>
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------ | <br>
| Identifiers | Names given to foreign things | cout std | <br>
| Literals |  | string literal | <br>
| Operators | Logical and arithmetic |  | <br>
| Punctuation |  |  | <br>
| White space |  |  | <br>

Escape sequence -> Allows us to escape the normal execution of code <br>

## Data Types and Operators
Logical operators -> AND / OR <br>
Bitwise operators -> Manipulate binary operations  <br>
char -> Input single character -> 't' <br>
bool -> True/false <br>
double/float -> decimals <br>
int -> short/long -> <br>

Declaration / Definition / Initialization of variables <br>
